### What I learned

Achieving the background was one of the most interesting parts of this project. I chose to place the two circle with absolute positioning, and I adjust the position on a couple breakpoints. I tried other methods that didn't seem better than this approach. I think with some JavaScript, you could position the circles nicely while scaling, but that's a bit overkill, especially for this project.
